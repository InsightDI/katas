## The Application
A client has asked you to architect a solution for a “Hello World” web application. This web application can be written in any language but must display a single rendered HTML page. The application must contain at least 2 instances for resiliency. The web application can be deployed to any platform of your choice, and it must be deployed to that platform via some form of automation. Each subsequent release of the application should be deployed with little or no interruption to availability.

## Acceptance Criteria
Complete the above application in one of two ways:
1. As _a thought exercise_, write a plan for how you would architect, implement, and manage the lifecycle of the application. Be as specific as possible, including diagrams, mind maps, and design documents. Be prepared to review and defend your design as though you were presenting to an architecture review board.
1. As a _proof of concept_, write automation for the application using any language, platform, and tools of your choice. Be prepared to teardown, update, and/or redeploy your solution live.

## Delivery
If you complete the thought exercise, please bring your plan and accompanying material with your or upload it somewhere publicly accessible on the web.
If you complete the proof of concept, please put the source code for your solution in a public version control repository of your choice.
